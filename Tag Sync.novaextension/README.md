**Tag Sync** provides automatic synchronisation of closing tag when editing opening tag.

Improve your coding efficiency by ensuring tag pairs stay synchronized while editing markup languages!


## Usage

Tag Sync runs any time you open a file, no need to activate it or summon it.

It does the following:

- Monitors when typing or editing is in an opening tag
- Detects when an opening tag is changed or completed
- Automatically finds and updates the corresponding closing tag to match

And it has been carefully designed to work with the most common editing scenarios:

- tag auto-completion
- replacing a selection
- backspace/delete

If you notice any issues or scenarios it does not deal with, please [report an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gingerbeardman/Tag-Sync/issues).
